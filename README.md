I'm learning kivy right now (trying to make a cute mobile app/game for Hack Club's Neighborhood). /tools and /practice are just me messing around with kivy to get to know it.

Game idea:

Navigating the bustling streets of London as a small chicken, Chip feels lost and alone. Help Chip find its way by scattering crumbs and drawing their attention to certain places. As you progress into the game, Chip's trust in the magical presence that guides it ( you ) grows into courage. Coming soon.

Version 3 (v3) is currently in progress.
